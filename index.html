        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Many start-ups falter due to equity disputes. Splitting a company equally between co-founders can lead to issues when not all co-founders contribute equally. As teammembers come and go on a project, cap tables can become bloated by teammembers who are no longer contributing. Dynamic equity splits are a great way to fairly track everyone's contributions once equity divisions are assigned at a later date. However, the process of recording everyone's contributions can be challenging. TeamTokens provides a simple, easy to use mobile application that allows for teammembers to quickly add and view equity distributions.</p>
